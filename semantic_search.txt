  How semantic-search works 

  the NLP algorithms break down the query into subsets. 
  They use tasks such as error correction, synonyms, POS tagging retrieval, and conversion to word embeddings to analyze the text. 
  Combining all these activities, they extract relevant details from the data source and present the user with precise results.
